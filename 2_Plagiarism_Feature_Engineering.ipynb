    "In this project, you will be tasked with building a plagiarism detector that examines an answer text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided, source text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task will be to create some features that can then be used to train a classification model. This task will be broken down into a few discrete steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clean and pre-process the data.\n",
    "* Define features for comparing the similarity of an answer text and a source text, and extract similarity features.\n",
    "* Select \"good\" features, by analyzing the correlations between different features.\n",
    "* Create train/test `.csv` files that hold the relevant features and class labels for train/test data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the _next_ notebook, Notebook 3, you'll use the features and `.csv` files you create in _this_ notebook to train a binary classification model in a SageMaker notebook instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be defining a few different similarity features, as outlined in [this paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/January/5c412841_developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers/developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers.pdf), which should help you build a robust plagiarism detector!\n",

At it's heart, this task is a comparison text; one that looks at a given answer and a source text, compares them and predicts whether an answer has plagiarized from the source. To effectively do this comparison, and train a classifier we'll need to do a few more things: pre-process all of our text data and prepare the text files (in this case, the 95 answer files and 5 original source files) to be easily compared, and split our data into a `train` and `test` set that can be used to train a classifier and evaluate it, respectively. \n",

Stratified sampling ensures that we get training and test data that is fairly evenly distributed across task & plagiarism combinations. Approximately 26% of the data is held out for testing and 74% of the data is used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function **train_test_dataframe** takes in a DataFrame that it assumes has `Task` and `Category` columns, and, returns a modified frame that indicates which `Datatype` (train, test, or orig) a file falls into. This sampling will change slightly based on a passed in *random_seed*. Due to a small sample size, this stratified random sampling will provide more stable results for a binary plagiarism classifier. Stability here is smaller *variance* in the accuracy of classifier, given a random seed."

    "One of the ways we might go about detecting plagiarism, is by computing **similarity features** that measure how similar a given answer text is as compared to the original wikipedia source text (for a specific task, a-e). The similarity features you will use are informed by [this paper on plagiarism detection](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/January/5c412841_developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers/developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers.pdf). \n",

    "Using these features as input, you will train a model to distinguish between plagiarized and not-plagiarized text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk a bit more about the features we want to include in a plagiarism detection model and how to calculate such features. In the following explanations, I'll refer to a submitted text file as a **Student Answer Text (A)** and the original, wikipedia source file (that we want to compare that answer to) as the **Wikipedia Source Text (S)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Containment\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task will be to create **containment features**. To understand containment, let's first revisit a definition of [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram). An *n-gram* is a sequential word grouping. For example, in a line like \"bayes rule gives us a way to combine prior knowledge with new information,\" a 1-gram is just one word, like \"bayes.\" A 2-gram might be \"bayes rule\" and a 3-gram might be \"combine prior knowledge.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> Containment is defined as the **intersection** of the n-gram word count of the Wikipedia Source Text (S) with the n-gram word count of the Student  Answer Text (S) *divided* by the n-gram word count of the Student Answer Text.\n",

    "$$ \\frac{\\sum{count(\\text{ngram}_{A}) \\cap count(\\text{ngram}_{S})}}{\\sum{count(\\text{ngram}_{A})}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the two texts have no n-grams in common, the containment will be 0, but if _all_ their n-grams intersect then the containment will be 1. Intuitively, you can see how having longer n-gram's in common, might be an indication of cut-and-paste plagiarism. In this project, it will be up to you to decide on the appropriate `n` or several `n`'s to use in your final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXERCISE: Create containment features\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the `complete_df` that you've created, you should have all the information you need to compare any Student  Answer Text (A) with its appropriate Wikipedia Source Text (S). An answer for task A should be compared to the source text for task A, just as answers to tasks B, C, D, and E should be compared to the corresponding original source text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll complete the function, `calculate_containment` which calculates containment based upon the following parameters:\n",
    "* A given DataFrame, `df` (which is assumed to be the `complete_df` from above)\n",
    "* An `answer_filename`, such as 'g0pB_taskd.txt' \n",
    "* An n-gram length, `n`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Containment calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The general steps to complete this function are as follows:\n",
    "1. From *all* of the text files in a given `df`, create an array of n-gram counts; it is suggested that you use a [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) for this purpose.\n",
    "2. Get the processed answer and source texts for the given `answer_filename`.\n",
    "3. Calculate the containment between an answer and source text according to the following equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >$$ \\frac{\\sum{count(\\text{ngram}_{A}) \\cap count(\\text{ngram}_{S})}}{\\sum{count(\\text{ngram}_{A})}} $$\n",
    "    \n",

    "* Given two texts: text A (answer text) of length n, and string S (original source text) of length m. Our goal is to produce their longest common subsequence of words: the longest sequence of words that appear left-to-right in both texts (though the words don't have to be in continuous order).\n",

    "\n",
    "If you read through the scenario above, you can see that this algorithm depends on looking at two texts and comparing them word by word. You can solve this problem in multiple ways. First, it may be useful to `.split()` each text into lists of comma separated words to compare. Then, you can iterate through each word in the texts and compare them, adding to your value for LCS as you go. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method I recommend for implementing an efficient LCS algorithm is: using a matrix and dynamic programming. **Dynamic programming** is all about breaking a larger problem into a smaller set of subproblems, and building up a complete result without having to repeat any subproblems. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach assumes that you can split up a large LCS task into a combination of smaller LCS tasks. Let's look at a simple example that compares letters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A = \"ABCD\"\n",
    "* S = \"BD\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see right away that the longest subsequence of _letters_ here is 2 (B and D are in sequence in both strings). And we can calculate this by looking at relationships between each letter in the two strings, A and S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I have a matrix with the letters of A on top and the letters of S on the left side:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='notebook_ims/matrix_1.png' width=40% />\n",
    "\n",
    "This starts out as a matrix that has as many columns and rows as letters in the strings S and O **+1** additional row and column, filled with zeros on the top and left sides. So, in this case, instead of a 2x4 matrix it is a 3x5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can fill this matrix up by breaking it into smaller LCS problems. For example, let's first look at the shortest substrings: the starting letter of A and S. We'll first ask, what is the Longest Common Subsequence between these two letters \"A\" and \"B\"? \n",

    "### The matrix rules\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to notice here is that, you can efficiently fill up this matrix one cell at a time. Each grid cell only depends on the values in the grid cells that are directly on top and to the left of it, or on the diagonal/top-left. The rules are as follows:\n",
    "* Start with a matrix that has one extra row and column of zeros.\n",
    "* As you traverse your string:\n",
    "    * If there is a match, fill that grid cell with the value to the top-left of that cell *plus* one. So, in our case, when we found a matching B-B, we added +1 to the value in the top-left of the matching cell, 0.\n",
    "    * If there is not a match, take the *maximum* value from either directly to the left or the top cell, and carry that value over to the non-match cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='notebook_ims/matrix_rules.png' width=50% />\n",
    "\n",
    "After completely filling the matrix, **the bottom-right cell will hold the non-normalized LCS value**.\n",

    "You should use feature correlation across the *entire* dataset to determine which features are ***too*** **highly-correlated** with each other to include both features in a single model. For this analysis, you can use the *entire* dataset due to the small sample size we have. \n",

    "All of our features try to measure the similarity between two texts. Since our features are designed to measure similarity, it is expected that these features will be highly-correlated. Many classification models, for example a Naive Bayes classifier, rely on the assumption that features are *not* highly correlated; highly-correlated features may over-inflate the importance of a single feature. \n",

detail to existing classes this is done by allowing the new classes to reuse the methods and variables of the existing classes and new methods and classes are added to specialise the new class inheritance models the is kind of relationship between entities or objects  for example postgraduates and undergraduates are both kinds of student this kind of relationship can be visualised as a tree structure where student would be the more general root node and both postgraduate and undergraduate would be more specialised extensions of the student node or the child nodes  in this relationship student would be known as the superclass or parent class whereas  postgraduate would be known as the subclass or child class because the postgraduate class extends the student class  inheritance can occur on several layers where if visualised would display a larger tree structure for example we could further extend the postgraduate node by adding two extra extended classes to it called  msc student and phd student as both these types of student are kinds of postgraduate student this would mean that both the msc student and phd student classes would inherit methods and variables from both

of a hyperlinked set of documents such as the world wide web with the purpose of measuring its relative importance within the set google assigns a numeric weighting from 0 10 for each webpage on the internet this pagerank denotes a site s importance in the eyes of google  the pagerank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the richter scale the pagerank of a particular page is roughly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the pagerank of the pages providing the links the algorithm may be applied to any collection of entities with reciprocal quotations and references the numerical weight that it assigns to any given element e is also called the pagerank of e and denoted by pr e  it is known that other factors e g relevance of search words

document is represented as a vector and each dimension corresponds to a separate term if a term appears in the document then its value in the vector is non zero many different ways of calculating these values also known as term weights have been developed one of the best known methods is called tf idf weighting  the definition of term depends on the application but generally terms are single words keywords or longer phrases if the words are chosen to be the terms the dimensionality of the vector is the number of words in the vocabulary which is the number of distinct words occurring in the corpus  the vector space model has several disadvantages firstly long documents are represented badly because they have poor similarity values secondly search keywords must accurately match document terms and substrings of words might result in a false positive match  thirdly documents with similar context but different term vocabulary will not be associated resulting in a false negative

females and sixty percent males as students the female students can only wear skirts or trousers in equal numbers whereas all the male students can only wear trousers an observer randomly sees a student from a distance and all he can see is that this student is wearing trousers what is the probability this student is female  there is a debate amongst frequentists and bayesians about how bayes theorem plays a major role around the beginnings of statistical mathematics frequentist and bayesian explanations do not agree about the ways in which probabilities should be assigned this is

problems by combining solutions to sub problems however unlike divide and conquer sub problems are not always independent as sub problems may share sub sub problems but solution to one sub problem may not affect the solutions to other sub problems of the same problem  there are four steps in dynamic programming  1 characterise structure of an optimal solution  2 define value of optimal solution recursively  3 compute optimal solution values either top down with caching or bottom up in a table  4 construct an optimal solution from computed values  an example of the type of problem for which dynamic programming may be used is given two sequences x x1 xm and y y1 yn find a common subsequence whose length is maximum  dynamic programming reduces computation by solving sub problems in a bottom up fashion and by storing solution to a sub problem the first time it is solved also looking up the solution when a sub problem is encountered again helps reduce computation however the key in dynamic programming is to determine the structure of optimal solutions  ,train\\n5,g0pB_taska.txt,a,0,0,inheritance is a basic concept in object oriented programming it models the reuse of existing class code in new classes  the is a kind of relationship  for example a house is a kind of building similarly an office block is a kind of building both house and office block will inherit certain characteristics from buildings but also have their own personal characteristics  a house may have a number of occupants whereas an office block will have a number of offices however these personal characteristics don t apply to all types of buildings  in this example the building would be considered the superclass  it contains general characteristics for other objects to inherit  and the house and office block are both subclasses  they are specific types and specialise the characteristics of the superclass  java allows object inheritance when one class inherits from another class all the public variables and methods are available to the subclass  public class shape private color colour public void setcolour color newcolour  colour  newcolour  public class circle extends shape private int radius public void setradius int newradius  radius  newradius  in this example the circle class is a subclass of the shape class the shape class provides a public setcolour method which will be available to the circle class and other subclasses of shape however the private variable colour as defined in the shape class will not be available for direct manipulation by the circle class because it is not inherited the circle class specialises the shape class which means that setradius is available to the circle class and all subclasses of circle but it isn t available to the superclass shape

coined the term in the 1940s to describe a method for solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another and by 1953 he refined his method to the current modern meaning  optimal substructure means that by splitting the programming into optimal solutions of subproblems these can then be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem one example is the computing of the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph first compute the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices then using this the best overall path can be found thereby demonstrating the dynamic programming principle this general three step process can be used to solve a problem  1 break up the problem different smaller subproblems  2 recursively use this three step process to compute the optimal path in the subproblem  3 construct an optimal solution using the computed optimal subproblems for the original problem  this process continues recursively working over the subproblems by dividing them into sub subproblems and so forth until a simple case is reached one that is easily solvable  ,test\\n10,g0pC_taska.txt,a,1,1,inheritance in object oriented

classes in this way allows us to define attributes and behaviours which are commen to all animals in one class so cheaters would natuarly inheart properities commen to all animals  the advantage of inheritance is that classes which would otherwise have alot of similar code  can instead shair the same code thus reducing the complexity of the program inheritance therefore can also be refered to as

selected and used to solve the overall problem these sub problems are only solved once and the solutions are saved so that they will not need to be recalculated again whilst calculated individually they may also overlap when any sub problem is met again it can be found and re used to solve another problem since it searches all possibilities it is also very accurate this method is far more efficient than recalculating and therefore considerably reduces computation it is widely used in computer science and can be applied for example to compress data in high density bar codes  dynamic

documents and objects as vectors of identifiers is called the vector space model  it is used in information filtering indexing relevancy rankings and information retrieval it was first used in the smart information retrieval system  when a document is represented as a vector each dimension corresponds to a separate term a term which occurs in the document has a value in the vector of non zero other ways of computing these values or weights have been developed the most popular is tf idf weighting depending on the application the definition of term varies  single words keywords and occasionally longer phrases are used for terms  the dimensionality of the vector if words are used as terms is the total number of words available for use  by using the assumptions of the document similarities theory the relevancy rankings of documents in a keyword search can be worked out by comparing the deviation of angles between vectors both within the document and the original query where the vectors of both are the same type the limitations of the vector space model are thus  due to poor similarity values long documents are poorly represented  false positive matches may be returned if search keywords do not precisely match document terms  false negative matches could be returned when documents share a context but have different term vocabulary  vector space representation results in the loss of the order which the terms are in the document ,train\\n33,g1pB_taskd.txt,d,2,1,bayes theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events  it is mainly used to calculate the probability of one events outcome given that a previous event happened  for example the probability that a doctors diagnosis is correct given that the doctor had previously observed symptoms in the patient  bayes theorem can be used for all forms of probability however it is currently at the centre of a debate concerning the ways in which probabilities should be assigned in applications  the theorem states that the probability of event a happening given event b is the probability of b given a multiplied by the probability of a regardless of b all divided by the probability of b regardless of a which acts as a normalising constant  bayes theorem formed in this way basically details how ones beliefs about event a are renewed or updated knowing that event b

by 1953 he had refined this to the modern meaning bellman s contribution is remembered in the name of the bellman equation a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form the word programming in dynamic programming has no particular connection to computer programming at all and instead comes from the term mathematical programming  a synonym for optimization thus the program is the optimal plan for action that is produced for instance a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program programming in this sense means finding an acceptable plan of action an algorithm dynamic programming usually takes one of two approaches the top down approach the problem is broken into sub problems and these sub problems are solved and the solutions remembered in case they need to be solved again this is recursion and memorization combined together and the bottom up approach all sub problems that might be needed are solved in advance and then used to build up solutions to larger problems this approach is slightly better in stack space and number of function calls but it is sometimes not intuitive to figure out all the sub problems needed for solving the given problem some programming languages can automatically memorize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments in order to speed up

weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents such as the world wide web with the purpose of measuring its relative importance within the set google assigns a numeric weighting from 0 10 for each webpage on the internet this pagerank denotes a site s importance in the eyes of google the pagerank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the richter scale pagerank is a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page pagerank can be calculated for collections of documents of any size it is assumed in several research papers that the distribution is evenly divided between all documents in the collection at the beginning of the computational process the pagerank computations require several passes called iterations  through the collection to adjust approximate pagerank values to more closely reflect the theoretical true value a probability is expressed as a numeric value between 0 and 1 a 0 5 probability is commonly expressed as a 50 chance of something happening hence a pagerank of 0 5 means there is a 50 chance that a person clicking on a random link will be directed to the document with the 0 5 pagerank the pagerank theory holds that even an imaginary surfer who is randomly clicking on links will eventually stop clicking the

although it is not always simple to find all of them any required sub problems are solved in advance and then used to create solutions to larger problems the other method is the top down approach

abstractly both will have a speed at which they are travelling a direction and a current position methods utilising this data can be specified high up in the inheritance hierarchy for example in a transport class for example you could have a method which works out the new position of a train after travelling x minutes in direction y likewise you might want to be able to find out the same information for an object of the type car  inheritance means that if such a method was defined in the superclass of the train and car classes any car or train object can utilise it  the train and car subclasses are said to extend the transport class as they will have additional characteristics which they dont share e g passenger capacity would be a class variable of both car and train but have different values  and a train may have methods along the lines of is toilet engaged if you then wanted to add additional forms of transport such as an aeroplane you may wish for that also to have a

its relative importance within the set  a particular websites pagerank results from a vote from other pages on the internet about how important that website actually is a link to a page is seen as a vote of support the pagerank depends on the pagerank rating and number of all pages that have links to it additionally if a page is linked to by pages with a high pagerank rating this increases the rating of the original page the pagerank scale ranges from 0 10 the rating of a certain page is generally based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the perceived quality of the pages

subsubproblems but the solution to one subproblem doesn t necessarily affect the solutions to other subproblems stemming from the same problem dynamic programming reduces computation time by solving subproblems in a bottom up way it stores the solution to a subproblem the first time it is solved meaning that it can look up the solution when that subproblem is encountered subsequently  the key to

inheritance is an important feature in object orientated programming this is because it allows new classes to be made that extend previous classes and to go into more detail  this is carried out by allowing the new class to reuse the existing class methods and variables whilst also creating class specific methods and variables this means that the new class the subclass is a more specialised version of the original or superclass  because of this it means that the subclass can use all the public methods and variables from the superclass however any private methods or variables are still private  also it should be noted that a class can only extend one class e g can only be a subclass to one superclass however a superclass can have more then one subclass and a class can both be a subclass and a superclass if this occurs then all of the non private methods and variables can be used by the most specialised class  this means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass then the subclass es then extend these to add more detail an example of this could be using a superclass of employee and then to have two subclasses called

depends on the number of incoming links anf the pagerank of those pages that provide the links pages that are linked to by many high ranking pages will themselves obtain a high rank if a page has no incoming links there is no support for that page the pagerank is a numeric weighting of 0 to 10 and denotes how important a site is in google s eyes like the richter scale the pagerank is a value on a logerithmic scale that is derived from a probability in addition to the quantity and quality of inbound links other factors affect the pagerank such as the number of visits to the page and the search

identifiers for example index terms it is used in information retrieval and filtering indexing and relevancy rankings and was first used in the smart information retrieval system  a document is represented as a vector with each dimension corresponding to a separate term if a term occurs in the document the value will be non zero in the vector many different ways of computing these values aka term weights have been developed one of the best known schemes is tf idf weighting  the way that a term is defined depends on the application typically terms are single words keywords or sometimes even longer phrases if the words are chosen as the terms the number of dimensions in the vector is the number of distinct words in the corpus  relevancy ranks for documents in a keyword search can be calculated this uses the assumptions of document similarities theory by comparing the difference of angles between each document vector and the original query vector where the query is represented as same format vector as the documents  generally it is easier to calculate the cosine of the angle between the vectors instead of the angle itself a zero value for the cosine indicates that the query and document vector are orthogonal and so had no match this means the query term did not exist in the document being considered  however the vector space model has limitations long documents are poorly represented due to their poor similarity values a small scalar product and a large dimensionality  search keywords must match precisely the document terms word substrings might result in a false positive match  similar context documents but different term vocabulary won t be associated leading to a false negative match  and the order that the terms appear in the document is not

to the style of programming that breaks a large problem down into smaller subproblems and generally allows for the finding of the optimal solution when the problem is split into subproblems these themselves may be split into smaller problems and so on until they cannot be reduced any more it is also common for dynamic programming to make use of recursion and the saving of previous results for faster computation later this also leads to higher efficiency as calculations are not being redone for example when a problem is reduced into sub problems and those are then reduced further it may be that there are common subsubproblems and so only one calculation needs to be done and the result saved to help solve more than one subproblem an example of this gain in efficiency is a path finding problem if there are two distinct routes in a network of 10 nodes tagged a to j then if the two routes share a common section say between nodes b and d  the cost of that section should be calculated for the first route and saved then when the second route is being processed the cost of b to d does not need to be calculated again in general dynamic programming is used on optimisation problems

from genetic inheritance where a child can inherit genetic characteristics from its parents  inheritance at its simplest allows programmers to model a relationship where one object is a kind of another  for instance two classes one representing an undergraduate student and another representing a post graduate student could both be said to belong to a more generalised class representing all students  similarly we could say that dogs and cats are two kinds of animal or that bridges and skyscrapers are two types of man made structure  subclasses are said to extend or specialise their superclasses  attributes variables and behaviours functions that are common between classes can be included in the definition of the superclass leaving the subclass definitions containing only the attributes and behaviours that are unique to that class  inheritance can be used to create a multiple level architecture of classes  in such an architecture even the bottom most subclasses inherit all of the attributes and behaviours that are defined in the very top most superclasses  this can save the programmer time because it renders unnecessary a lot of code duplication

developed by google s competitors for their search engines is part of the second generation of technologies designed to rate the importance of web pages the first which was solely based on keywords in the page content and meta data could easily be influenced by those wishing to obtain a higher ranking for their less relevant pages  the different with pagerank is that it tries to determine a web page s relevance to users by attempting to determine its importance  it does this by assigning it a value of importance that is dependant upon the number of web sites that link to that page taking into account the importance value or pagerank of those pages  the pagerank is computed iteratively and it is found that the pagerank values converge fairly rapidly  although it is much better than simple keyword based ranking algorithms pagerank is not infallible we have an internet where advertising revenue can make up most  and quite frequently all  of a web site s income and the people that run these web sites will always be trying to trick the system into giving their pages a higher pagerank  one of google s attempts to counter this is their google toolbar browser plugin  google toolbar is a free tool which provides a number of useful functions in a convenient location the users web browser window  google s payoff is that it gets to track the behaviour of actual users  this allows them to see whether their pagerank algorithm is accurate in assigning high pagerank values to the most relevant web pages and just as importantly low values to those that are irrelevant and try to

is a method for efficiently solving a broad range of search and optimization problems which exhibit the characteristics of overlappling  dynamic programming design technique like divide and conquer method  the leading and most up to date textbook on the far ranging algorithmic methododogy of dynamic programming which can be used for optimal control the word programming in the name has nothing to do with writing computer programs mathematicians use the word to describe a set of rules which anyone can follow to solve a problem they do not have to be written in a computer language  dynamic programming was the brainchild of an american mathematician richard bellman who described the way of solving problems where you need to find the best decisions one after another in the forty odd years since this development the number of uses and applications of dynamic programming has increased enormously  for example in 1982 david kohler used dynamic programming to analyse the best way to play the game of darts  1 in recent years dynamic programming languages develope very fastly especially php and ruby there is no doubt that they have already became the first choice for many programmerers when developing web applications when you learn a new natural language and you start to use it you naturally you find yourself using new concepts and paradigms that enrich the use of the language you

objects using classes that have already been defined the inheritance concept was invented in 1967 for simula  the new classes known as derived classes take over or inherit attributes and behavior of the pre existing classes which are referred to as base classes or ancestor classes  it is intended to help reuse existing code with little or no modification  inheritance provides the support for representation by categorization in computer languages categorization is a powerful mechanism number of information processing crucial to human learning by means of generalization what is known about specific entities is applied to a wider group given a belongs relation can be established and cognitive economy less information needs to be stored about each specific entity only its particularities  inheritance is also sometimes called generalization because the is a relationships represent a hierarchy between classes of objects for instance a fruit is a generalization of apple  orange  mango and many others one can consider fruit to be an abstraction of apple orange etc conversely since apples are fruit i e  an apple is a fruit  apples may naturally inherit all the properties common to all fruit such as being a fleshy container for the seed of a plant  an advantage of inheritance is that modules with sufficiently similar interfaces can share a lot of code reducing the complexity of the program inheritance therefore has another view a dual called polymorphism which describes many pieces of code being controlled by shared control code inheritance is typically accomplished either by overriding replacing one or more methods exposed by ancestor or by adding new methods to those exposed by an ancestor  complex inheritance or inheritance used within a design that is not sufficiently mature may lead to the yo yo problem ,orig\\n96,orig_taskb.txt,b,-1,-1,pagerank is a link analysis algorithm used by the google internet search engine that assigns a numerical weighting to each

democratic nature of the web by using its vast link structure as an indicator of an individual page s value in essence google interprets a link from page a to page b as a vote by page a for page b but google looks at more than the sheer volume of votes or links a page receives it also analyzes the page that casts the vote votes cast by pages that are themselves important weigh more heavily and help

support the pagerank of a page is defined recursively and depends on the number and pagerank metric of all pages that link to it  incoming links  a page that is linked to by many pages with high pagerank receives a high rank itself if there are no links to a web page there is no support for that page google assigns a numeric weighting from 0 10 for each webpage on the internet this pagerank denotes a site s importance in the eyes of google the pagerank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the richter scale the pagerank of a particular page is roughly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the pagerank of the pages providing the links it is known that other factors e g relevance of search words on the page and actual visits to the page reported by the google toolbar also influence the pagerank in order to prevent manipulation spoofing and spamdexing google provides no specific details about how other factors influence

vector model is an algebraic model for representing text documents and any objects in general as vectors of identifiers such as for example index terms it is used in information filtering information retrieval indexing and relevancy rankings its first use was in the smart information retrieval system a document is represented as a vector each dimension corresponds to a separate term if a term occurs in the document its value in the vector is non zero several different ways of computing these values also known as term weights have been developed one of the best known schemes is tf idf weighting see the example below  the definition of term depends on the application typically terms are single words keywords or longer phrases if the words are chosen to be the terms the dimensionality of the vector is the number of words in the vocabulary the number of distinct words occurring in the corpus  the vector space model has the following limitations 1 long documents are poorly represented because they have poor similarity values a small scalar product and a large dimensionality 2 search keywords must precisely match document terms word substrings might result in a false positive match 3 semantic sensitivity documents with similar context but different term vocabulary won t be associated resulting in a false negative match 4 the order in which the terms appear in the document is lost in the vector space representation ,orig\\n98,orig_taskd.txt,d,-1,-1,in probability theory bayes theorem often called bayes law after rev thomas bayes relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events it is often used to compute posterior probabilities given observations for example a patient may be observed to have certain symptoms bayes theorem can be used to compute the probability that a proposed diagnosis is correct given that observation  see example 2 as a formal theorem bayes theorem is valid in all common interpretations of probability however it plays a central role in the debate around the foundations of statistics frequentist and bayesian interpretations disagree about the ways in which probabilities should be assigned in applications frequentists assign probabilities to random events according to their frequencies of occurrence or to subsets of populations as proportions of the whole while bayesians describe probabilities in terms of beliefs and degrees of uncertainty the articles on bayesian probability and frequentist probability discuss these debates in greater detail bayes theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events a and b where b has a non vanishing probability p a b frac p b  a  p a  p b  each term in bayes theorem has a conventional name  p a is the prior probability or marginal probability of a it is prior in the sense that it does not take into account any information about b  p a b is the conditional probability of a given b it is also called the posterior probability because it is derived from or depends upon the specified value of b  p b a is the conditional probability of b given a  p b is the prior or marginal probability of b and acts as a normalizing constant intuitively bayes theorem in this form describes the way in which one s beliefs about observing a are updated by having observed b  ,orig\\n99,orig_taske.txt,e,-1,-1,in mathematics and computer science dynamic programming is a method of solving problems that exhibit the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure described below  the method takes much less time than naive methods the term was originally used in the 1940s by richard bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another by 1953 he had refined this to the modern meaning the field was founded as a systems analysis and engineering topic that is recognized by the ieee bellman s contribution is remembered in the name of the bellman equation a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form the word programming in dynamic programming has no particular connection to computer programming at all and instead comes from the term mathematical programming  a synonym for optimization thus the program is the optimal plan for action that is produced for instance a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program programming in this sense means finding an acceptable plan of action an algorithm optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem for example the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices and then using this to pick the best overall path as shown in figure 1 in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3 use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem the subproblems are themselves solved by dividing them into sub subproblems and so on until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time figure 2 the subproblem graph for the fibonacci sequence that it is not a tree but a dag indicates overlapping subproblems to say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems for example in the fibonacci sequence f3  f1  f2 and f4  f2  f3  computing each number involves computing f2 because both f3 and f4 are needed to compute f5 a naive approach to computing f5 may end up computing f2 twice or more this applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved in order to avoid this we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved then if we need to solve the same problem later we can retrieve and reuse our already computed solution this approach is called memoization not memorization although this term also fits  if we are sure we won t need a particular solution anymore we can throw it away to save space in some cases we can even compute the solutions to subproblems we know that we ll need in advance ,orig\\n'"
